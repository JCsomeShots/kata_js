    <h1>Addition without Carrying</h1>
    <h2>Task</h2>
    <p>
        A little boy is studying arithmetics. He has just learned how to add two integers, written one below another, column by column. But he always forgets about the important part - carrying.

        Given two integers, find the result which the little boy will get.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        For param1 = 456 and param2 = 1734, the output should be 1180</p>
    <p>
        The little boy goes from right to left:

        6 + 4 = 10 but the little boy forgets about 1 and just writes down 0 in the last column

        5 + 3 = 8

        4 + 7 = 11 but the little boy forgets about the leading 1 and just writes down 1 under 4 and 7.

        There is no digit in the first number corresponding to the leading digit of the second one, so the little boy imagines that 0 is written before 456. Thus, he gets 0 + 1 = 1.
    </p>
    <h2>Input/Output</h2>
    <p>
        [input] integer a
        A non-negative integer.
        Constraints: 0 ≤ a ≤ 99999.
        [input] integer b
        A non-negative integer.
        Constraints: 0 ≤ b ≤ 59999.
        [output] an integer
        The result that the little boy will get.
